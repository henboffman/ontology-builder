## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Integration

Lighthouse CI will automatically run:
- ‚úÖ On every push to `main` or `develop`
- ‚úÖ On every pull request
- ‚úÖ Weekly (Sundays at midnight) for trend monitoring
- ‚úÖ Manual trigger via GitHub Actions tab

### Viewing Results in GitHub
1. Go to the "Actions" tab
2. Click on "Lighthouse CI" workflow
3. View run results
4. Download artifacts (HTML reports)
5. PR comments show score summaries

---

## üìà What Happens Next

### On First Run
The first Lighthouse run will establish **baseline scores**. These might be lower than budgets initially - that's okay! Use this as a starting point for optimization.

### If Tests Fail
1. **Don't panic!** Failing tests help identify issues early
2. Review the HTML reports (`.lighthouseci/lhr-*.html`)
3. Follow recommendations in the Lighthouse audit
4. Check `LIGHTHOUSE_CI.md` for common issues and fixes
5. Adjust budgets if needed (in `lighthouserc.js`)

### Continuous Improvement
- Monitor scores over time
- Investigate sudden drops in performance
- Use weekly runs to track trends
- Tighten budgets as you optimize

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Run Your First Audit
```bash
# Make sure app is running first!
npm run lighthouse
```

### 2. Review the Results
Look for:
- Which budgets are passing/failing
- Biggest performance opportunities
- Accessibility issues
- SEO improvements

### 3. Create a Performance Baseline
Document your starting scores:
```
Initial Lighthouse Scores (2025-10-26):
- Performance (Desktop): ___%
- Accessibility: ___%
- Best Practices: ___%
- SEO: ___%
- LCP: ___s
```

### 4. Address Low-Hanging Fruit
Common quick wins:
- ‚úÖ Add missing alt text to images
- ‚úÖ Add meta descriptions to pages
- ‚úÖ Optimize image sizes
- ‚úÖ Enable text compression

### 5. Set Up GitHub Integration
Push to GitHub to trigger the first automated run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Add Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring"
git push origin main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### NPM Vulnerabilities
You may see some vulnerability warnings:
```
12 vulnerabilities (7 low, 5 high)
```

These are in transitive dependencies of Lighthouse CI. You can:
- **Option A:** Ignore (they're dev dependencies, not production)
- **Option B:** Run `npm audit fix` (may break things)
- **Option C:** Wait for Lighthouse CI to update dependencies

**Recommendation:** Ignore for now. These don't affect your production application.

### Deprecated Packages
Some warnings about deprecated packages (rimraf, glob, inflight) are from Lighthouse CI's dependencies. These don't affect functionality.

## üîç Understanding Your First Run

### Expected Results (Blazor Server)
Blazor Server applications typically score:
- **Performance:** 60-80 (acceptable)
- **Accessibility:** 85-95 (good)
- **Best Practices:** 90-95 (excellent)
- **SEO:** 80-90 (good)

### Why Blazor Scores Lower on Performance
- SignalR connection overhead
- Large initial JavaScript payload
- WebSocket latency

**This is normal!** Focus on:
- Post-load interactivity
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS)
- User-perceived performance
