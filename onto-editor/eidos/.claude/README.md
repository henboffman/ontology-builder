## How to Use These Files

### For Claude Code
These files provide context for Claude Code to:
1. Understand project structure and conventions
2. Generate code that follows established patterns
3. Provide accurate suggestions and fixes
4. Maintain consistency across the codebase
5. Reference common development workflows

### For Developers
Use these files to:
1. Onboard new team members quickly
2. Reference coding standards
3. Understand system architecture
4. Find examples of common patterns
5. Debug issues with context-aware help

## Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start development
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Create migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName

# Build for production
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

### Key Service Locations
- **Business Logic**: `Services/`
- **Data Access**: `Data/Repositories/`
- **Real-time**: `Hubs/OntologyHub.cs`
- **UI Components**: `Components/`
- **Models**: `Models/`

### Important Patterns
- Always use `OntologyPermissionService` for access control
- Use `IDbContextFactory` for scoped contexts
- Include comprehensive logging with structured placeholders
- Wrap critical operations in try-catch with user-friendly errors
- Use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries

## Updating This Context

When adding major features:
1. Update `../claude.md` with high-level feature description
2. Update `../DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER.md` with detailed technical entry
3. Add relevant guidelines to `guidelines.md` if new patterns introduced
4. Update `architecture.md` if system design changed
5. Consider adding new prompts to `prompts.json` for the feature
