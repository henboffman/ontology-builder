# Agent-Based Application Development Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to building applications using specialized AI agents, from initial requirements gathering through production deployment.

## Core Principles

1. **Requirements First**: Never start coding without clear, documented requirements
2. **Architecture Before Implementation**: Design the system before building it
3. **Document As You Go**: Maintain the development ledger continuously
4. **Agent Specialization**: Use the right agent for each task
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine requirements and architecture based on discoveries
6. **Quality Gates**: Each phase has clear completion criteria
7. **Traceability**: Every implementation decision traces back to a requirement

## Guide Structure

This guide is organized into the following documents:

### [1. Development Ledger Guide](./DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER_GUIDE.md)

The Development Ledger is the single source of truth for your project's evolution. This guide covers:

- Ledger structure and location
- What to track and when
- How to maintain it throughout development
- Templates for all ledger sections

### [2. Project Phases Guide](./PROJECT_PHASES_GUIDE.md)

Comprehensive guide to all development phases:

- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering
- **Phase 2**: Architecture & Design
- **Phase 3**: Development Setup & Infrastructure
- **Phase 4**: Feature Development
- **Phase 5**: Quality Assurance & Testing
- **Phase 6**: Production Readiness
- **Phase 7**: Production Deployment & Hypercare

Each phase includes objectives, process steps, agent usage, deliverables, and completion criteria.

### [3. Agent Usage Guide](./AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md)

How to effectively use specialized agents:

- Agent specializations and when to use each
- Agent usage patterns and best practices
- Prompt templates for common tasks
- Agent combination strategies
- Quick reference table

### [4. Documentation Standards](./DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md)

Standards and templates for all project documentation:

- Repository documentation structure
- Feature plan templates
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- API documentation standards
- Operations documentation templates
- Code documentation standards

### [5. Operations & Support Guide](./OPERATIONS_SUPPORT_GUIDE.md)

Operational excellence and support readiness:

- Production readiness checklist
- Runbook templates and standards
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Incident response procedures
- Support team training
- Deployment procedures
- Hypercare and BAU transition

### [6. Best Practices & Troubleshooting](./BEST_PRACTICES_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

Guidance for common scenarios:

- Documentation best practices
- Agent usage best practices
- Quality best practices
- Common issues and solutions
- Continuous improvement approaches
