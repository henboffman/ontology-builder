## 2025-10-31 - Collaboration Board & Automated Group Management

### Features Added

#### ü§ù Collaboration Board System
- **CollaborationBoardService**: Comprehensive service for managing collaboration posts and responses
  - `GetActivePostsAsync()`: Get all active collaboration posts
  - `SearchPostsAsync()`: Search and filter posts by domain, skill level, keywords
  - `GetPostDetailsAsync()`: Get detailed post information with view tracking
  - `GetMyPostsAsync()`: Get user's own collaboration posts

  - `GetPostResponsesAsync()`: Get all responses for a post
  - `UpdateResponseStatusAsync()`: Accept/reject responses with automatic group membership

#### üîë Automated Permission Workflow
- **Automatic Group Creation**: When creating a collaboration post:
  - Creates user group named "Collaboration: [Project Title]"
  - Adds post creator as group admin
  - Links collaboration post to the group via `CollaborationProjectGroupId`
  - Sets ontology visibility to "Group" if ontology is attached
  - Grants group "Edit" permission on the ontology

- **Seamless Collaborator Onboarding**: When accepting a collaboration response:
  - Automatically adds user to the collaboration project group
  - User immediately gains edit access to the ontology
  - No manual permission configuration required
  - When declining/removing, automatically removes user from group

#### üé® UI Components
- **CollaborationBoard.razor** (`/collaboration`): Browse and search active projects
  - Filter by domain and skill level
  - Search functionality
  - View detailed project cards
  - Apply to projects

- **MyCollaborationPosts.razor** (`/collaboration/my-posts`): Manage your posts

  - Shows group names, member counts, and permission levels
  - Real-time group permission visibility
  - Fixed permission level enum mapping (view, edit, admin ‚Üí View, ViewAddEdit, FullAccess)

- **OntologyHub.cs**: Updated SignalR permission checks
  - Changed from old `UserShareAccesses` check to `OntologyPermissionService.CanViewAsync()`
  - Now properly recognizes group-based permissions
  - Enables real-time collaboration for group members

#### üß™ Development Tools
- **DevSwitchUser.razor** (`/dev/switch-user`): Multi-user testing page (development only)
  - Quick links to switch between test users
  - Interactive server mode for seamless user switching

- **DevSwitchUserEndpoint.cs**: API endpoint for user switching
  - Handles authentication outside Blazor response pipeline
  - Signs out current user and signs in as selected user

  - Development-only with environment check

- **DevelopmentAuthMiddleware.cs**: Enhanced auto-login middleware
  - Checks for "manual-user-switch" cookie
  - Skips auto-login when user has manually switched accounts
  - Preserves manual user switches across page refreshes

### Database Changes
- Uses existing `CollaborationPosts` table with `CollaborationProjectGroupId` column
- Uses existing `UserGroups`, `UserGroupMembers`, `OntologyGroupPermissions` tables
- No new migrations required

### Files Modified

#### Services
- `/Services/CollaborationBoardService.cs` - Added automatic group creation and permission grant logic
- `/Services/OntologyPermissionService.cs` - Used for permission checks in hub

#### UI Components
- `/Components/Settings/PermissionsSettingsTab.razor` - Implemented group access display
- `/Components/Pages/CollaborationBoard.razor` - Main collaboration discovery page
- `/Components/Pages/MyCollaborationPosts.razor` - User's posts management page
- `/Components/Pages/DevSwitchUser.razor` - Development user switcher (NEW)

#### SignalR
- `/Hubs/OntologyHub.cs` - Updated permission checks to use OntologyPermissionService

#### Endpoints
- `/Endpoints/DevSwitchUserEndpoint.cs` - User switching API (NEW)

#### Middleware
- `/Middleware/DevelopmentAuthMiddleware.cs` - Added manual switch cookie check

#### Documentation
- `/Components/Shared/ReleaseNotes.razor` - Documented collaboration features
- `/DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER.md` - This entry

### Technical Details

#### Collaboration Lifecycle
1. **Post Creation**:
   - User creates collaboration post for their ontology
   - System creates `UserGroup` named "Collaboration: [Title]"
   - Creator added as group admin
   - Group granted "Edit" permission to ontology
   - Ontology visibility changed to "Group"

2. **Response Submission**:
   - Other users apply to join the project
   - Response created with "Pending" status

3. **Response Acceptance**:
   - Post owner accepts response
   - Status changed to "Accepted"
   - User automatically added to collaboration group
   - User immediately gains edit access to ontology

4. **Collaboration**:
   - Collaborators can view and edit ontology
   - Real-time presence tracking via SignalR
   - Permission checks validate group membership
   - Visible in Permissions tab

#### Permission Level Mapping
Database stores permission levels as strings, but UI uses enum:
- `"view"` ‚Üí `PermissionLevel.View`
- `"edit"` ‚Üí `PermissionLevel.ViewAddEdit`
- `"admin"` ‚Üí `PermissionLevel.FullAccess`

Fixed in `PermissionsSettingsTab.razor` line 178-183

#### Development Testing Workflow
1. Navigate to `/dev/switch-user`
2. Click user to switch to (e.g., test@test.com, collab@test.com)
3. Cookie prevents auto-login from overriding
4. Test collaboration workflow from different user perspectives

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed permission denied errors when group members tried to access ontologies
- Fixed "No groups have been granted access yet" message when groups existed
- Fixed enum mapping errors in PermissionsSettingsTab
- Fixed `OntologyId.HasValue` error (changed to `OntologyId > 0`)

### Performance Considerations
- Group creation and permission grant happen in single transaction
- Efficient permission checks via `OntologyPermissionService`
- Real-time updates via SignalR for collaborators
- Cookie-based state for user switching (minimal overhead)

### Security Enhancements
- Development user switcher only works in Development environment
- Permission checks enforce at multiple layers (Hub, Service, UI)
- Group membership validated before granting ontology access
- Automatic permission management reduces manual configuration errors

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Email notifications when responses are accepted/declined
- [ ] In-app notifications for collaboration updates
- [ ] Collaboration analytics (response rates, active projects)
- [ ] Project completion/archival workflow
- [ ] Collaboration activity feed
- [ ] Group chat/messaging for collaborators
- [ ] Permission level adjustments after acceptance

  - Checks view permission before loading ontology
  - Checks edit permission and combines with share permissions
  - Prioritizes most restrictive permission level
  - Shows appropriate error messages for unauthorized access

#### üîß OAuth Login Improvements
- **Conditional OAuth Buttons**: Login page now only shows OAuth buttons for configured providers
  - `LoginModel.IsGoogleConfigured`: Detects if Google OAuth is configured
  - `LoginModel.IsMicrosoftConfigured`: Detects if Microsoft OAuth is configured
  - `LoginModel.IsGitHubConfigured`: Detects if GitHub OAuth is configured
  - Prevents users from clicking unconfigured OAuth providers
- **OAuth Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to all OAuth event handlers
  - GitHub OAuth `OnCreatingTicket` event
  - Google OAuth `OnCreatingTicket` event
  - Microsoft OAuth `OnCreatingTicket` event
  - Prevents login failures from breaking the authentication flow
  - Logs errors for debugging without disrupting user experience

### Database Changes
- No new migrations required (uses existing `OntologyGroupPermissions`, `UserGroups`, `UserGroupMembers` tables)
- Leverages existing `Visibility` and `AllowPublicEdit` columns on `Ontologies` table

### Files Modified

#### Services
- `/Services/OntologyPermissionService.cs` - Core permission management logic

#### UI Components
- `/Components/Ontology/OntologySettingsDialog.razor` - Added Permissions tab with group management
- `/Components/Pages/OntologyView.razor` - Integrated permission checks
- `/Components/Pages/Home.razor` - Filtered ontology list by permissions

#### Authentication
- `/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml` - Conditional OAuth button rendering
- `/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml.cs` - OAuth provider configuration detection
- `/Program.cs` - OAuth event handler error handling

### Tests Added
- `/Eidos.Tests/Integration/Services/OntologyPermissionServiceTests.cs` - 20+ comprehensive tests covering:
  - View permission checks (owner, public, private, group)
  - Edit permission checks (owner, public edit, group edit/view)
  - Manage permission checks (owner, group admin)
  - Group permission management (grant, update, revoke)
  - Visibility updates
  - Accessible ontologies query

- `/Eidos.Tests/Unit/Pages/LoginModelTests.cs` - 12 tests covering:
  - OAuth provider configuration detection (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
  - Multiple provider scenarios
  - Register mode detection
  - URL toggling

### Technical Details

#### Permission Hierarchy
1. **Owner**: Full access (view, edit, manage)
2. **Group Admin**: Full access except changing ownership
3. **Group Edit**: Can view and edit
4. **Group View**: Can only view
5. **Public Edit**: Anyone can edit public ontologies with flag enabled
6. **Public View**: Anyone can view public ontologies

#### Visibility Levels
- **Private**: Only owner can access
- **Group**: Only owner and specified groups can access
- **Public**: Anyone can view, optionally edit

### Performance Considerations
- Permission checks use EF Core's `Include()` for efficient loading
- Group permissions cached in memory during component lifetime
- Real-time updates use `InvokeAsync()` for reactive UI

### Security Enhancements
- OAuth login errors no longer expose sensitive error details to users
- Permission checks enforce at both UI and service layers
- Group membership validated before granting access
