# Floating Panels Implementation

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Feature**: Advanced Floating Panels for Add/Edit Concept and Relationship Forms
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented modern, draggable floating panels to replace the cramped sidebar editors for concepts and relationships. This provides a "top-tier UX" similar to VS Code, Figma, and Linear, where forms float over the content and can be freely moved around the screen.

## Motivation

Previously, the add/edit concept and relationship forms were confined to a 25% width sidebar on desktop (lines 331-372 in OntologyView.razor), which felt constrained and blocked the main content area. Users wanted:

1. **Better screen real estate utilization** - Forms that don't block the main view
2. **Freedom of movement** - Ability to reposition forms while working
3. **Modern UX** - Professional, polished interaction similar to leading design tools
4. **Persistent positioning** - Remember where panels were placed between sessions

## Implementation Details

### 1. Base FloatingPanel Component (`Components/Shared/FloatingPanel.razor`)

**Purpose**: Reusable base component that provides floating panel functionality

**Key Features**:
- Three size variants: Compact (350px), Standard (450px), Expanded (600px)
- Draggable by header with viewport constraints
- Optional semi-transparent backdrop
- Keyboard support (Escape to close)
- Smooth fade-in/scale animations (200ms)
- Clean disposal via IAsyncDisposable

**Parameters**:
```csharp
- Title: string - Panel header title
- Icon: string - Bootstrap icon name (without "bi-" prefix)
- IsVisible: bool - Controls panel visibility
- Size: PanelSize enum - Compact | Standard | Expanded
- IsDraggable: bool - Enable/disable dragging (default: true)
- ShowBackdrop: bool - Show semi-transparent backdrop (default: true)
- CloseOnBackdropClick: bool - Close when backdrop clicked (default: false)
- ShowFooter: bool - Display footer section (default: false)
- ChildContent: RenderFragment - Main panel content
- FooterContent: RenderFragment? - Optional footer content
```

**Structure**:
1. Backdrop layer (z-index: 1040) - Semi-transparent overlay
2. Panel container (z-index: 1050) - Positioned absolutely
3. Header - Title, icon, and close button (drag handle)
4. Body - Scrollable content area
5. Footer (optional) - Action buttons area

### 2. JavaScript Drag Logic (`wwwroot/js/floating-panel.js`)

**Purpose**: Handle drag interactions and position persistence

**FloatingPanelManager Class**:
```javascript
class FloatingPanelManager {
    constructor()
    initializePanel(panelId, options)
    onDragStart(e, panelId)
    onDrag(e, panelId)
    onDragEnd(e, panelId)
    centerPanel(panelId)
    savePosition(panelId, position)
    loadPosition(panelId)
    destroyPanel(panelId)
}
```

**Drag Behavior**:
- Mouse down on header starts drag
- Viewport constraints: 20px padding from edges
- Position saved to localStorage on drag end
- Smooth cursor feedback (header cursor: move)
- Box shadow enhancement while dragging

**Global Functions** (for Blazor JS Interop):
- `initializeFloatingPanel(panelId, options)`
- `destroyFloatingPanel(panelId)`
- `centerFloatingPanel(panelId)`

### 3. CSS Styling (`wwwroot/css/floating-panel.css`)

**Key Styles**:

**Backdrop**:
```css
.floating-panel-backdrop {
    position: fixed;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
    z-index: 1040;
    transition: opacity 200ms ease-in-out;
}
```

**Panel Container**:
```css
.floating-panel {
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 1050;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    transition: opacity 200ms, transform 200ms;
}
```

**Animations**:
- Fade in: opacity 0 → 1
- Scale: transform scale(0.95) → scale(1)
- Dragging enhancement: box-shadow 0 12px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)

**Dark Mode Support**:
- Darker backdrop: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)
- Enhanced shadows for better visibility
- Adjusted hover states for close button

**Responsive Design**:
- Mobile (< 768px): Width = calc(100vw - 32px), max 450px
- Desktop: Respects size variants (350/450/600px)

### 4. AddConceptFloatingPanel Component (`Components/Ontology/AddConceptFloatingPanel.razor`)

**Purpose**: Wrapper for ConceptEditor in a floating panel

**Key Details**:
- Wraps existing ConceptEditor component
- Passes through all 13 ConceptEditor parameters
- Exposes `FocusNameInput()` method for UX
- Standard panel size by default
- Shows "Add Concept" or "Edit Concept" based on IsEditing

**Usage Example**:
```razor
<AddConceptFloatingPanel @ref="addConceptFloatingPanel"
                         IsVisible="@showAddConcept"
                         OnClose="@CancelEditConcept"
                         ConceptName="@newConcept.Name"
                         ...other parameters... />
```

### 5. AddRelationshipFloatingPanel Component (`Components/Ontology/AddRelationshipFloatingPanel.razor`)

**Purpose**: Wrapper for RelationshipEditor in a floating panel

**Key Details**:
- Wraps existing RelationshipEditor component
- Passes through all 14 RelationshipEditor parameters
- Standard panel size by default
- Shows "Add Relationship" or "Edit Relationship" based on IsEditing

### 6. Integration into OntologyView (`Components/Pages/OntologyView.razor`)

**Changes Made**:

**A. Removed Desktop Sidebar Editors** (Line 330-372):
```razor
<!-- BEFORE: Desktop sidebar contained inline ConceptEditor and RelationshipEditor -->
<div class="d-none d-md-block col-md-3 ontology-sidebar">
    @if (showAddConcept || editingConcept != null)
    {
        <ConceptEditor ... /> <!-- 43 lines of parameters -->
    }
    else if (showAddRelationship)
    {
        <RelationshipEditor ... /> <!-- 39 lines of parameters -->
    }
    ...
</div>

<!-- AFTER: Sidebar only shows detail panels (Individuals, selected items) -->
<div class="d-none d-md-block col-md-3 ontology-sidebar">
    <!-- ConceptEditor and RelationshipEditor moved to floating panels -->
    @if (showAddIndividual || editingIndividual != null)
    {
        <IndividualEditor ... />
    }
    ...
</div>
```

**B. Added Floating Panels** (Lines 969-1014):
```razor
<!-- Floating Panels for Add/Edit Concept and Relationship -->
<AddConceptFloatingPanel @ref="addConceptFloatingPanel"
                         IsVisible="@(showAddConcept || editingConcept != null)"
                         OnClose="@CancelEditConcept"
                         ... />

<AddRelationshipFloatingPanel IsVisible="@(showAddRelationship || editingRelationship != null)"
                              OnClose="@CancelEditRelationship"
                              ... />
```

**C. Updated Component Reference** (Line 1050):
```csharp
// BEFORE:
private ConceptEditor? conceptEditor;

// AFTER:
private AddConceptFloatingPanel? addConceptFloatingPanel;
```

**D. Updated Focus Logic** (Line 1466):
```csharp
// BEFORE:
if (conceptEditor != null)
{
    await conceptEditor.FocusNameInput();
}

// AFTER:
if (addConceptFloatingPanel != null)
{
    await addConceptFloatingPanel.FocusNameInput();
}
```

**E. Registered Assets in App.razor**:
```razor
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@Assets["css/floating-panel.css"]" />

<!-- JS -->
<script src="js/floating-panel.js"></script>
```

## User Experience Flow

### Adding a Concept:
1. User clicks "Add Concept" button in List view, Graph view, or mobile menu
2. Floating panel fades in with scale animation (200ms)
3. Panel appears centered on screen (or last saved position if available)
4. Semi-transparent backdrop appears behind panel
5. User can drag panel by header to reposition
6. Panel position saved to localStorage on drag end
7. User fills in concept details
8. **Ctrl+Enter**: Save & Add Another (form stays open, refocuses name field)
9. **Click Save**: Form closes with fade-out animation
10. **Click backdrop or Escape**: Form closes (no save)

### Editing a Concept:
1. User clicks edit icon on concept in List view
2. Floating panel opens with concept data pre-filled
3. Same interaction as adding, but "Save & Add Another" button hidden
4. Changes saved on "Save" click

### Adding a Relationship:
1. User clicks "Add Relationship" button or Ctrl+Click on graph node
2. Floating panel opens with appropriate concepts pre-selected if triggered from graph
3. User selects source/target concepts and relationship type
4. Panel can be moved to see graph while selecting
5. Save closes panel

## Technical Advantages

### 1. Non-Blocking Design
- Semi-transparent backdrop allows seeing content behind
- Draggable to move out of the way
- No layout shifts when opening/closing

### 2. Performance
- CSS transitions (GPU-accelerated)
- Lazy initialization of drag listeners
- Efficient localStorage access (only on drag end)
- Proper cleanup via IAsyncDisposable

### 3. Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
- ARIA-compliant close button
- Clear visual focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

### 4. Maintainability
- Reusable base component
- Existing ConceptEditor/RelationshipEditor unchanged
- Clean separation of concerns
- Well-documented parameters

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile Modal Unchanged**: Mobile users still get the bottom modal (lines 679-967). Could potentially use floating panels on mobile too, but modal is appropriate for small screens.

2. **Individuals Still in Sidebar**: IndividualEditor still appears in sidebar. Could be moved to floating panel in future if desired.

3. **Single Panel at a Time**: Only one concept or relationship panel can be open at once (controlled by showAddConcept/showAddRelationship booleans). Could support multiple panels simultaneously if needed.

4. **No Z-Index Management**: If multiple floating elements exist, there's no z-index stacking management. Not currently an issue since only one panel opens at a time.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Size Toggle**: Allow users to switch between Compact/Standard/Expanded sizes via button in header
2. **Multiple Panels**: Support having both concept and relationship panels open simultaneously
3. **Minimize/Maximize**: Add minimize button to collapse panel to header-only mode
4. **Snap to Edges**: Magnetic snapping when dragging near viewport edges
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Global shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+C for "Add Concept"
6. **Panel Memory**: Remember which panel was last used and open it automatically
7. **Individual Floating Panel**: Move IndividualEditor to floating panel for consistency
8. **Mobile Floating Panels**: Consider using floating panels on larger mobile devices (tablets)

## Conclusion

The floating panels implementation provides a modern, professional UX that maximizes screen real estate utilization while maintaining the existing ConceptEditor and RelationshipEditor functionality. The design is reusable, performant, accessible, and sets the foundation for future UI improvements.

The user's goal of a "top-tier user experience" with freely moveable, non-blocking panels has been achieved. Forms no longer feel cramped in the sidebar, and users can reposition them as needed while working with their ontologies.

**Next Steps**: Manual testing in browser, followed by implementation of the layout reorganization plan (right sidebar for view navigation, persistent validation panel at bottom 30%).
